missing-provider-requirement/mod/missing-provider-requirement.tf:11,1-39: Resource for undeclared provider; There is no provider with the local name "unofficial" declared in this module's required_providers block.\n\nThis resource does not explicitly select a provider configuration using the "provider" argument, and so Terraform assumes it should belong to the default configuration for a provider named "unofficial" based on the prefix of the resource type name.
